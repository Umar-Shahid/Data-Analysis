## 📊 Featured Projects

### 1. 🚴 Cyclistic Bike Share Analysis
**[View Notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/muhammadumarshahid) | [View Dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/muhammad.umar.shahid)**

Comprehensive analysis of 500,000+ bike-share trip records to identify customer behavior patterns and inform marketing strategy.

**Business Problem:**  
Cyclistic wants to convert casual riders into annual members to increase profitability and reduce customer acquisition costs.

**My Approach:**
- Cleaned and validated 500,000+ trip records using Python (Pandas, NumPy)
- Performed exploratory data analysis examining ride duration, frequency, timing patterns
- Used SQL to aggregate data by user type, day of week, and time periods
- Created interactive Tableau dashboard for stakeholder presentation
- Conducted statistical analysis to quantify segment differences

**Key Findings:**
- Annual members show **35% higher weekday usage**, indicating commuter behavior
- Casual riders take **2x longer trips** on average (28 min vs 14 min)
- Weekend usage patterns differ dramatically: **60% spike for casuals vs 15% for members**
- Peak hours reveal distinct use cases: Members peak at 8am/5pm (commute), casuals at 2-4pm (leisure)

**Business Impact:**
Delivered three data-driven recommendations:
1. Target weekend casual riders with conversion campaigns emphasizing commute savings
2. Offer trial memberships during peak casual usage months (June-August)
3. Create weekend-only membership tier to capture leisure riders

**Projected Result:** 15-20% increase in membership conversions

**Tech Stack:** Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib), SQL, Tableau
